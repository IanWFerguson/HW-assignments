  <h1>Nested Selectors in CSS</h1>

	<p>Often, we may find ourselves wanting to style things <em>differently</em> depending on their <em>context</em>.</p>

	<p>Take emphasis as an example. In typical copy, presented in a roman (non-italic) type, we may wish to add <em>emphasis</em> to a word or phrase by using <em>italics</em>.</p>

	<p>But what if we want to quote a block of text which also emphasizes something?</p>

	<blockquote>
  		<p>This is a quote from some famous person who undoubtedly has something <em>very important</em> to say.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>If we want our block quote to be set in italics by default, then the visual style for emphasis needs to be different, <em>but only when inside a blockquote</em>.</p>

	<p>This is where <em>nested selectors</em> come in handy.</p>

	Now you can practice on our unordered list.  Select only the first li's in the list to have a background color of red.
	And select all list items to have a font weight of bold.

	<ul>
	  <li>List item 1</li>
	  <li>List item 2</li>
	    <ol>
	      <li>Nested li</li>
	      <li>Nested li</li>
	    </ol>
	  <li>List item 3</li>
	</ul>
	<ol>
		<li>Coffee</li>
		<li>tea</li>
		<li>beans</li>
	</ol>
	<ol>
		<li>Socks</li>
		<li>Shoes</li>
		<li>Hat</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Bonus:
		<ul>
			<li>Style all ordered lists that are immediate adjacent siblings to unordered lists to have a border around them.
			</li>
			<li>
			Style all ordered lists on the same level as unordered lists to also have blue backgrounds</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
