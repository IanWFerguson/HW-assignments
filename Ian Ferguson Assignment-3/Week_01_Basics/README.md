## Week 1 - The Basics

This week is about leveling the playing field. 

There will be some students who find this week slow. But we want to make sure all students are at a basic level before moving on, as this will make the rest of the class go smoothly. 

We will also take time to get up to speed with new tools...like Sublime Text 3 and github.
